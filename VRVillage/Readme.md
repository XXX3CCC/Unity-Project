## Target a VR App on a mobile phone, navigate using the phoneâ€™s capabilities, and display a scene in stereo using Google Cardboard. The model displayed is a low polygon medieval village from Unity assets.

### Part I: In mono mode (no cardboard VR), please develop a way to navigate the virtual world by pointing with your finger on the screen using basic gestures

### Part II: Implement navigation in the virtual world by using the magnetic clicker provided with the Google cardboard. The main idea is that once you click, you should move slowly in the direction you are looking with your cardboard.
